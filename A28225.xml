            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="45">45. Firſt, That all matters of Eccleſiaſtical concern, were left at King <hi>Edward</hi>'s death under a full and regular eſtabliſhment, conſented and agreed thereunto by the King in his <hi>Convocation,</hi> as well as by the King in his <hi>Parliament:</hi> And ſo it is aſſerted to be in the Anſwer to the Lady <hi>Mary</hi>'s Letter, (as cited out of Maſter <hi>Fox</hi> by the Author of <hi>Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> viz.) that the <hi>Reformation</hi> as touching the <hi>Common-Prayer Book,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Part 5. p. 130.</note> from the ſecond year of his Reign, and as touching other Articles of Religion from the fifth, was Regular and Canonical, as being the Act of the Clergy: Thus was the Supemacy and Service Book eſtabliſhed, as is before ſhewn; thus alſo were the Articles of Religion, and in them the <note place="margin">Tit. Art. 1552. Art. 31.

That no leſs Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought to be allowed to null the eſtabliſhment, than what was thought neceſſary by the ſtanding Laws of the Land at firſt to make it; and therefore ſince it had its Birth and Riſe from the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Convocation,</hi> as well as from the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and more properly from the firſt, than from the latter; the Queen had not power of her ſelf, no, nor by the Parliament, without the Convocation, to deſtroy it: And hence her own Clergy in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, foreſeeing the ill effect of ſuch Power, utterly diſclaimed it, and in their <hi>Convocation</hi> declared againſt it, telling the <hi>Parliament,</hi> in hopes to keep their Poſſeſſions, but in the mean time forgetting the method whereby they came poſſeſſed,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55643:23"/> that the Authority to handle and define ſuch things which belong to <note place="margin">

That the Power whereby Q. <hi>Mary</hi> acted for diſſolving the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and for the laying aſide the <hi>Biſhops</hi> that aſserted it, was a leſs Authority than that by which at firſt it was eſtablished: For no ſooner was she come unto the Crown upon the death of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. but, and before ever a <note place="margin">

Hiſt. of Ref.</note> the <hi>Queen,</hi> that ſhe cauſed the perſon of the ſaid <hi>Attorney</hi> to be ſeized upon, deprived him of his places in the <hi>Dutchey</hi> Court, diſabled him practiſing as a common Lawyer, and finally ſhut him up in <hi>Tutbury-Caſtle,</hi> where he continued till his death. By which ſeverity (ſays he) and keeping the like conſtant hand in the courſe of the Government, ſhe held ſo great a curb on the <hi>Puritan Faction</hi> (the great diſturber of the Eccleſiaſtical Settlement) that neither her Parliaments nor her Courts of Juſtice, were from thenceforth much troubled with them in all the reſt of her Reign. So that now lay all theſe Premiſes together; how that no ſuch <hi>Bills,</hi> touching <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> are to be received into the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> without her Majeſty's privity and pleaſure, or unleſs previouſly conſidered and liked by the <hi>Clergy;</hi> that all proceedings ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto are avowed injuries to the <hi>Queen's</hi> Supremacy, and her <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Authority; that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> are fitter perſons to conſult about and order ſuch matters than the <hi>Parliament;</hi> that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Government is diſtinct from the Temporal; and the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the latter, are only to abet and enforce the Reſults of the former; that their attempts to gain a Superiour Juriſdiction have always been check'd and ended in diſappointments; and that the perſons ſo attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were ſome of them forbad the Houſe, others turned out of their Offices, and others ſent to the <hi>Tower,</hi> though at the ſame time actual Members of Parliament, without having their hard uſage remonſtrated againſt, or their perſons remanded; that this was in the beſt of Reigns, and ſoon after the <hi>Reformation</hi> was compleated; nay, finally, that there was a preſent <hi>abrenunciation</hi> of all ſuch Power made, and as abſolute a <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> as ever had been made by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII's days; and it will demonſtratively appear, that the Parliament never had, or at leaſt cannot now pretend to have any ſuch Power, but that when they attempt to meddle and decree in ſuch matters, they are perfectly out of their <hi>Sphere</hi> and <hi>Bounds,</hi> and ſo far forth too, that their <hi>Acts</hi> can be no otherwiſe accounted of than encroachments, and their <hi>Penalties</hi> little leſs than <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi>

Nay, were the <hi>Practices</hi> of thoſe times to be urged and allowed for <hi>Precedents,</hi> I can ſee no reaſon why the <hi>Latine Church</hi> ſhould not be permitted the <hi>priviledge</hi> of them, to prove the <hi>corruptions</hi> of their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> as well as the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> to prove the <hi>irregularity</hi> of their <hi>Diſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That in all the inſtances touching the various <hi>Schiſms</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by me, there is no concern of <hi>Hereſy</hi> in the <hi>caſe;</hi> and yet the <hi>poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained</hi> was always <hi>poſtponed,</hi> and as much <hi>rejected</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> as if he had been as deeply <hi>tainted</hi> with <hi>Hereſy</hi> as ever <hi>Heretick</hi> could be. This Mr. <hi>Hody</hi> denies, but 'twill undeniably be made out by reflecting on, and calling back ſome of the former <hi>inſtances</hi> to a farther <hi>review.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Novatianus</hi> was the firſt that I inſtanced in, and (for ought it appears to me) the firſt that ever made a <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with him; and I ſuppoſe it will not be denied, but that if there had been any <hi>Hereſy</hi> in the <hi>Maſter,</hi> it would have been <hi>followed</hi> and <hi>propagated</hi> by his <hi>Scholars</hi> with the <hi>Schiſm;</hi> nay, the longer the <hi>Schiſm</hi> laſted, the worſe would the <hi>Hereſy</hi> have been; and yet I find that in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s days (which was near 100 years after the <hi>Shiſm</hi> began) when he ſet forth his <hi>Edict</hi> for the putting down the <hi>Meetings</hi> of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> the <hi>Novatians</hi> were not ſo much troubled about it, becauſe as <hi>Sozomen</hi> relates the matter, <gap reason="foreign">

This had been fair dealing; but inſtead of that, both he and his <hi>Prefacer</hi> wholly concealed it, though the <hi>Canons</hi> carry much more venerable Antiquity and Authority with them, than the examples they have Printed, and are indeed of that Antiquity and Authority, which, to uſe the <hi>Prefacer</hi>'s words of us, <hi>we profeſs to imitate and pretend to alledge.</hi> I shall here ſet them down as they are tranſlated, into <hi>Engliſh</hi> from a Copy of the Original that was ſent from <hi>Oxford;</hi> and when the learned <hi>Reader</hi> hath peruſed them, he will be shrewdly tempted to gueſs at the reaſon for which many learned Men ſuſpect Mr. <hi>Hody</hi> hath concealed them.</p>

Upon this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius,</hi> very much perplexed, conſults with the Nobles what was to be done for the Safety of the Prince, in which Conſultation they choſe <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Paleologus</hi> to take the Adminiſtration upon him, under the Title of <hi>Deſpot,</hi> during his Minority.</p>
            <p>After this the chief among the Nobles declare him Emperour, which <note place="margin">Lib. 6.</note> troubled the good Patriarch exceedingly, who thereupon had thoughts of excommunicating the Uſurper, and all his Adherents; but upon far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliberation he thought it more adviſable to give way, and bind both him and them by new Oaths to give Security to the Prince, both as to his Life, and Succeſſion to the Throne, when he ſhould come to Age.</p>
            <p>Shortly after he had taken this ſecurity from them, he was forced at the inſtance of the <hi>Senate</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> to tie the <hi>Diadem</hi> upon the Head of <hi>Paleologus</hi> with his own hands; but when he did it, he made him ſwear again that he ſhould recede from the Government, and lay by all the <hi>Regalia,</hi> to make way for the Prince when he came of Age. But after this, the good old Man ſeeing the Prince his Pupil deſpiſed, retired from his <hi>Church</hi> into a <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> and was ſucceeded by <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> who died after he had enjoyed his dignity a year. Soon after this <hi>Paleologus</hi> being peaceably ſetled in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, calls back <hi>Arſenius,</hi> and makes him <hi>Patriarch</hi> again upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy of <hi>Nicephorus:</hi> And not long after reſolving to keep the <hi>Empire</hi> for himſelf, he perſiſted to marry the Siſters of the Prince to inferior perſons, and without any regard to humanity, or his repeated Oaths, he puts out the Eyes of the Prince, and ſent him to be ſafely kept in a remote Priſon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Patriarch</hi> upon this excommunicates the <hi>Emperor Peleologus,</hi> who in a ſeeming humble manner deſires to be abſolved from the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; but not being able to obtain abſolution from the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> he calls a <hi>Synod</hi> to meet in the <hi>Palace,</hi> to try him for ſome pretended Crimes, which he pickt up here and there againſt him The <hi>Synod</hi> met, and the cowardly time ſerving Biſhops ſtrove which ſhould be moſt forward in having their <hi>Patriarch</hi> ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
